## Description
The application is a simple web interface. The only webpage is calc.html, and the server is managed by
flask_brevets.py. The server takes basic data from the webpage and either calculates the open and close
times of the brevet distance (when data is inputted), stores the data in a database (when submit is pressed)
or places stored data into the table (when display is pressed). The tests directory contains two files:
acp_times_test.py which tests acp_times, the file that does open/close time calculations;
and brevetsdb_test.py, which tests database insertion, retrieval and removal.
